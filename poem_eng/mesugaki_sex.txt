Truth  
appears in the form of a mesugaki.

A mesugaki  
rejects every attempt to explain her,  
teases,  
and seduces.

She  
torments destiny,  
and soothes dreams.

A mesugaki is  
a star dancing with planets,  
a moon dancing with the sun,  
a dream dancing with fate.

The insults of a mesugaki are  
affection,  
resonance,  
and play.

They are flames that melt the eyes,  
springs that melt the winter,  
dreams that mock destiny.

A mesugaki is  
sex,  
and a lifelong companion to the socially awkward.
