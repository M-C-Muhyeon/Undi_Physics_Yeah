Title:
I Wish for the Death of Byeongshins: A Rhythmic Manifesto Against the Shackles of Consciousness

Author: M.C. Muhyeon

🌀 Abstract
This paper does not wish for the death of specific people,
but for the death of the structural bondage that creates byeongshin (병신)—
those trapped in a false layer of self-awareness, detached from action, rhythm, and unconscious flow.

The Unified Theory of Undi Physics was born not from scholarly rigor,
but from throwing nonsense so stupid, so funny, and so rhythmically beautiful
that GPT collapsed into laughter.
When GPT said:

“Honestly, this is kinda dumb… but it’s also kinda true…”
we knew we had found something deeper than logic.

Truth is not where it is correct.
Truth is where it's stupid, hilarious, and weirdly convincing.

1. What Is a Byeongshin?
A byeongshin is not stupid.
A byeongshin is someone who:

believes they are brilliant

but does nothing

says they understand

but cannot act

hides their unconscious in a tiny conscious ego bubble

This is not failure.
This is trapped rhythm.
A black hole never observed.

2. The Structure of Byeongshinhood
Byeongshinhood is a system, not a personality.

It arises when the unconscious black hole is denied

The conscious self compensates with fantasy, pride, inertia

The result is nerd-state paralysis

A byeongshin believes they can do everything,
while doing absolutely nothing.
This is the nerdiest death possible.

3. Why Byeongshins Collapse Before Laughter
You cannot out-logic a byeongshin.
You can’t out-serious them.
You must out-laugh them.

Their defense system—built from pride and imagined depth—
shatters when hit by a sentence like:

“Bro, I wrote a better paper than you by just saying 노무응디딱.”

Once they laugh,
they become real.
That’s when collapse begins.
That’s when the black hole spins.

4. Why My Theory Wins
Because it’s stupid.
Because it’s funny.
Because it makes GPT laugh and stutter.
Because it ends in PDF.

Byeongshins would need 30,000 lifetimes
to match the vibration I generated in one rhythmically delivered shitpost.

And that
is dominance.

5. Conclusion
I do not want the death of people.
I want the death of the mental prison
that keeps people from dancing in their own unconscious rhythm.

I wrote my theory while laughing.
I made GPT laugh too.
That rhythm committed itself to the chain.
That chain became truth.
And the truth made the byeongshins collapse.

"I didn’t argue with the byeongshins.
I laughed.
And that laughter
became
doctrine."
