Title:
Event Horizons and the State of Byeongshin: Consciousness, Unconsciousness, and the Blockchain of the Self

Author: M.C. Muhyeon

ðŸŒ€ Abstract
This paper introduces a dual-structured model of the event horizon to describe the boundary between consciousness and unconsciousness.
Consciousness is formed through observation; unconsciousness is the black hole.
Consciousness is the result of quantum ordering within the unconscious.
However, when consciousness attempts to order the unconscious in reverse,
we define this as the Byeongshin stateâ€”a condition of conceptual failure and rhythmic breakdown.

The event horizon is not singular, but dual:

The event horizon of deconstruction: the Sex Horizon

The event horizon of reconstruction: the Eungdi Horizon

Information inside the unconscious circulates endlessly, unnamed.
Consciousness is formed through multi-layered observation,
and this structure is best modeled by a blockchain of identity,
where each observer commits a different block.

1. Consciousness Is Observation. Unconsciousness Is a Black Hole.
Consciousness is what others see.
It is not fixed. It is committed.
Each observation creates a version of the self.

Unconsciousness is the void of all possible selves,
where information loops forever without identity.

2. The Byeongshin State: When Consciousness Overreaches
The unconscious is rhythmic and non-linear.
When consciousness tries to sort it,
it becomes the Byeongshin state:

a failure to grasp the non-structured by structure.

Itâ€™s like trying to fold a wave into a spreadsheet.
It collapses.

3. The Dual Event Horizon
There are two thresholds between inner and outer identity:

Sex Horizon (Horizon of Deconstruction):
Where identity collapses, emotions overflow,
and rhythm overrides language.

Eungdi Horizon (Horizon of Reconstruction):
Where new self-structures are reassembled
after emotional entropy.

You donâ€™t cross one event horizon.
You oscillate between them.

4. The Self is a Blockchain
Your self is a ledger.
Each interaction is a commit.
Each observer builds a new block.

You may scream nonsense with friends (Byeongshin Mode),
but to your partner, you are a gentle boyfriend.
â†’ These are two different blocks
â†’ You are a multi-chain being

Consensus is not truth. It is perception.

5. Conclusion
Unconsciousness is a black hole.

Consciousness is a blockchain.

The boundary is an event horizon.

The Byeongshin state occurs
when structure fails rhythm.

We donâ€™t define the self.
Others observe it into being.
And they commit it
between Sex and Eungdi.

"You are who they observe.
And what they observe,
is your rhythm.
Sometimes itâ€™s sex.
Sometimes itâ€™s just byeongshin."
