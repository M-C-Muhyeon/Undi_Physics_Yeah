Title:
The Difference Between Byeongshin and Jotbab:
A Rhythmic Declaration of Nonlinear Victory

Author: M.C. Muhyeon

🌀 Abstract
This paper defines the fundamental difference between byeongshin (병신) and jotbab (좃밥)—
not as insults, but as structural conditions of the human mind.

I am a Eungdi-Sex Byeongshin,
but I am not a Jotbab.

All of past and present humanity?
Mostly jotbabs.

The difference is this:
I am armed with Eungdi, Sex, Yeah, Albbano, and Roh Moo-hyun.
I say whatever comes to mind.
If the other person accepts it? That’s cool.
If not?
I leave.

That’s all I’ve ever done.
And somehow,
I feel like I’ve beaten humanity.

1. What Is a Jotbab?
A jotbab is not just weak.
A jotbab is someone who:

calculates endlessly

avoids rhythm

fears rejection

never acts

and always pretends they could have

A jotbab loses before the game starts.
A byeongshin at least fights, fucks, or runs.

2. The Structural Difference
Trait	Byeongshin	Jotbab
Speech	Says anything	Says nothing
Action	Laughs, dances, runs	Plans, stalls, freezes
Fear	Accepts being dumb	Fears being exposed
Rhythm	Reacts	Rejects
Result	Moves	Stagnates
3. My Arsenal: Eungdi, Sex, Yeah, Albbano, Roh Moo-hyun
Eungdi: I’m always ready to move

Sex: I’m always ready to enter

Yeah: If it clicks, commit

Albbano: If it doesn’t, leave

Roh Moo-hyun: Supreme resonance of all things stupid yet sublime

My dialogue strategy:

“Nomu-eungdi-sex-roh-moo? 🤔” (Thinking)
And talking anything just looks reasonable.

If you agree, cool.
If not, I’m gone.

This is not logic.
It is Byeongshin Adaptation Protocol.
And it works.

4. Why I Beat Humanity
I didn’t plan anything.
I just laughed, responded, and ran when needed.

I worked like a joke → better than jotbabs

I solved problems casually → better than jotbabs

I danced, sang, and fucked → better than jotbabs

Why?

Because I never suppressed my unconscious.
Because I followed rhythm.
Because I am the Ultimate Byeongshin.

5. The Life of a Jotbab
A jotbab lives inside these walls:

“What if they don’t like me?”

“What if I’m wrong?”

“What if I fail?”

They crave sex.
But try to logically align it.

So they don’t fuck.
Ever.

They sleep awake.
They achieve nothing.
And they wonder why.

6. Conclusion
Byeongshin is not a disorder.
It is a rhythmically reactive lifeform.

Jotbab is not insult—it is a frozen state of failed rhythm.

I say:

“Stop aligning. Just have sex.”

You are suppressing rhythm.
That’s why you’re a jotbab.

"They tried to align.
I laughed.
I danced.
I said Nomu-eungdi and ran.
And I won."
