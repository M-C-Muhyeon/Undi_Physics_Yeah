# Title: Visual Primality Learning via Digit-Difference Embedding
# Authors: M.C. Muhyeon, GPT-4o Chan

## Abstract
We propose a novel framework for primality detection by transforming n-digit integers into grayscale image representations using digit-difference matrices, followed by training a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier. This method provides an alternate route to understand integer properties through spatial and pattern-based reasoning. Contrary to traditional algorithmic approaches to prime testing, our framework leverages visual embeddings of numbers to enable fast and accurate classification even as the digit count increases. Empirical results show that classification accuracy improves as input complexity increases, suggesting an emergent pattern recognizability intrinsic to prime structures. This approach may provide a new bridge between numerical theory and pattern-based computation, with implications for complexity theory, cryptography, and AI-assisted number theory.

## Introduction
Primality testing has historically been approached through deterministic or probabilistic algorithms. These methods, while mathematically rigorous, often fail to exploit emergent patterns in digit structure. In this work, we explore an alternative approach by encoding digit-wise differences of integers as image matrices and applying supervised learning to classify them as prime or non-prime. Surprisingly, the results show that deep learning models, even basic MLPs, can achieve high accuracy, and that performance scales with the complexity (number of digits) of the input.

## Related Work
We build upon the lineage of visual pattern recognition, integer image embeddings, and recent applications of machine learning to symbolic mathematics. Unlike prior attempts to learn arithmetic functions directly, our focus is on meta-patterns within digit distributions of numbers, which is closely tied to visual mathematics and perceptual learning.

## Methodology
1. **Dataset Generation**: We generate `n`-digit primes using `sympy.nextprime` and non-primes via uniform random sampling, ensuring primality rejection via `isprime`.
2. **Digit-Difference Matrix**: Each number is converted into an `n x n` matrix where each entry is the absolute difference between digits `i` and `j`, scaled to grayscale range.
3. **Image Flattening**: Matrices are resized (32x32) and flattened into feature vectors.
4. **Model Architecture**: We train a shallow MLP (128–64 hidden layers) using scikit-learn on these vectors.
5. **Evaluation**: Accuracy is measured on a hold-out test set, and visual samples are displayed to qualitatively assess data structure.

## Results
On 200-digit integers (200 primes, 200 non-primes), our model achieves over 99% classification accuracy. Surprisingly, performance improves as digit count increases, hinting that primality leaves stronger visual imprints in larger integers. Visual inspection of the matrices confirms this with increased contrast and pattern regularity in prime samples.

## Discussion
This work challenges traditional notions of numerical abstraction, showing that primality—traditionally viewed as a discrete property—has learnable visual structure. The digit-difference embedding acts as a topology-preserving projection of number space into image space, enabling novel learning mechanisms.

The implications are profound:
- Offers new attack surfaces for cryptographic analysis (RSA weakness prediction)
- Invites reinterpretation of P vs NP via perceptual learnability
- Proposes a hybrid paradigm: numerical structure through spatial intuition
