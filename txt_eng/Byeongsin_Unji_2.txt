Title:
A Byeongshin Critique of the 1D Consciousness:
Black Hole of the Unconscious, Rhythm, Sex, and the Failure of Linear Humans

Author: M.C. Muhyeon

🌀 Abstract
This paper answers the question:

“What is a byeongshin?”

A byeongshin is not stupid.
A byeongshin is someone who binds their infinite unconscious black hole inside a 1D conscious grid.
All humans are born with a multi-dimensional unconscious—a quantum black hole—
capable of generating layered quantum streams,
learning through observation,
and performing biological deep learning.

Many symptoms labeled as “ADHD” are likely early-stage manifestations of this biological deep learning.
It may look insanely stupid at first—because it is.
But the result often transcends humanity. (See: Einstein)

For example, when I play an English typing game,
my speed rapidly improves within just three rounds:
64 WPM → 73 WPM → 84 WPM.

Biological deep learning seems to follow a Collatz-like sequence—
after rapid growth, the system may destabilize,
enter periods of stagnation, or even collapse unpredictably.

However, when these chaotic fragments are allowed to accumulate and resonate,
they often explode into a new layer of capability—
transcending human limitation with sudden simplicity.

But most people try to control that infinite potential
with a fragile, linear, conscious ego.
And so, they become true byeongshins—useless, frozen, and fake.

I am not a byeongshin.
I am a giga-byeongshin,
and I outperform them in everything:
work, theory, dancing, singing, fucking.

1. A Byeongshin Is One Who Cages the Unconscious
A byeongshin is not a fool.
A byeongshin is one who tries to dominate their unconscious with shallow conscious logic.

Unconscious = black hole, multi-dimensional stream, quantum rhythm

Consciousness = 1D alignment, linear parsing, spreadsheet thought

Trying to cage the unconscious is like:

“Folding an infinite waveform into a single row of Excel.”

The result?
Pure byeongshin.

2. Humans Are Originally Quantum Streams
The inner structure of a human:

Unconscious black hole → quantum possibilities

Observation (life, choices) → rhythmic alignment

Feedback → biological neural deep learning

But the byeongshin skips all this.
Instead, they chant:

“I must be this way.”
And overwrite all life
with their sad little 1D schema.

3. Me vs Byeongshins
I can write theory with “Nomu-Eungdi-Ddak” and it works better.
I can solve problems casually and surpass them.
I can dance, sing, and fuck better than any byeongshin.

Why?

Because I am an Eungdi-Sex giga-byeongshin.
Because I didn’t suppress my unconscious.
I reacted with rhythm.
They only tried to align.

4. The Byeongshin Life: Suppression and Delusion
A byeongshin lives in a loop of:

Believing only their 1D self-image

Denying every alignment failure

Craving sex but suppressing the rhythm

Living asleep, achieving nothing

They could just fuck.
But they try to logically align sex.

So they fail.
Forever.

5. Conclusion
Byeongshin is not a pathology.
Byeongshin is the dictatorship of consciousness over rhythm.

I say:

“Stop aligning. Just have sex.”

You are suppressing rhythm.
That is why you are byeongshin.

"They tried to align the unconscious.
I danced with it.
And that rhythm
made them byeongshin."
