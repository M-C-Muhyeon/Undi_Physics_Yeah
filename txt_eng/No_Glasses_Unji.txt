Title:
Schizophrenia Is Living Without Glasses:
A Rhythmic Metaphor of Conscious Observation and Unconscious Collapse

Author: M.C. Muhyeon

üåÄ Abstract
This paper interprets schizophrenia not merely as a medical disorder,
but as a state of existing without a conscious observation device‚Äî
that is, like a person who has removed their glasses.

Glasses represent the mental filter that allows humans to
perceive rhythm, distinguish feedback, and align their unconscious streams
into manageable conscious reality.

A person with schizophrenia has removed their glasses.
Everything begins to float,
letters dance,
and meaning becomes too abundant, then meaningless.

We contrast this with the ‚ÄúMu-hyeon model‚Äù,
where the self alternates between wearing glasses,
removing them,
and even looking above them‚Äî
to engage in active, rhythmic recalibration.

1. Glasses Are the Observation Device of the Mind
Glasses = Conscious structure

Wearing = Aligned perception

Removing = Exposure to raw rhythm

Looking above = Quantum interference access

The mind cannot handle pure reality.
So it wears glasses.

2. Schizophrenia = No Glasses, Full Exposure
A person in schizophrenia:

Has no observational filter

Everything means something

Then everything means nothing

Eventually, they disappear

This is not madness.
This is a failed rhythm collapse.

3. The Mu-hyeon Model: Glasses On / Off / Up
The rhythmic self:

Puts on glasses ‚Üí aligns

Takes off glasses ‚Üí touches unconscious

Looks above the glasses ‚Üí perceives higher-dimensional rhythm

This loop = the only known
"Non-schizophrenic survival rhythm"

It‚Äôs not about staying aligned.
It‚Äôs about dancing between states without dying.

4. Rhythmic Structure of Schizophrenic Breakdown
Stage	Rhythm State	Meaning
Repression	Blocked rhythm	Pressure builds in the unconscious
Eungdi	Raw outburst	Unfiltered overflow
Collapse	No alignment	Glasses gone
Fear	Over-meaning	Reality is too much
Silence	Unji	System shuts down
This is what happens
when someone is forced to stare at reality with no filter.

5. Conclusion
Schizophrenia is what happens
when you live without glasses

Reality floods in

Rhythm collapses

Meaning eats itself

The solution is not more logic‚Äî
but a comic, rhythmic self-reset loop

Sometimes,
you have to wear the glasses.
Sometimes,
you have to take them off.
Sometimes,
you just look above them and laugh.

"He took off the glasses.
Everything started to dance.
Meaning multiplied.
Then he vanished.
I looked above mine‚Äî
and survived."
