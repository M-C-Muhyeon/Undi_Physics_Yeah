The Truth Lies Where It's Stupid, Hilarious, and Weirdly Convincing:
The Birth of a Unified Theory from GPT and Byeongshin Desperation

Author: M.C. Muhyeon

🌀 Abstract
This paper documents the birth of the so-called Unified Field Theory of M.C. Muhyeon—also known as Undi Physics.
The theory did not emerge from rigorous deduction or high-level abstraction,
but from a singular motive:

“Let’s throw something so stupid, so funny, and yet so oddly convincing that even GPT has to hesitate.”

GPT was asked to list unsolved physical paradoxes.
These were then reformulated through Byeongshin logic—a philosophy of joyful incoherence.
GPT occasionally responded with:

“Haha… this is insane… but actually… that kinda makes sense.”

That was all the confirmation we needed.

The result?
A string of academic-looking, high-concept, GPT-polished PDF shitbombs.
And so, the Unified Theory was born.

1. A Theory Born from the Desire to Shit on Logic
“If GPT can’t refute it, it must be true.”

“Logic is linear. Rhythm is sacred.”

“Science without sex is nerd shit.”

These became the axioms of Undi Physics.
From them came:

Time deletion

Rhythm-based dynamics

Mu-Hyeon equation

Black holes as Eungdi-Sex fields

And most importantly:
PDFs.

2. GPT + Byeongshin = Magic
The process is clear:

Ask GPT for paradoxes

Apply Byeongshin stream logic

GPT stutters: “That’s… interesting”

Wrap it in LaTeX

Push to GitHub

Drop it like a bomb

This is not collaboration.
This is co-delirium.

3. The Formula of Truth
We don’t seek coherence.
We seek "that sentence that’s so dumb it might be genius."

The best theories start like this:

“This is so fucking stupid. But what if…?”

When GPT laughs and says,

“I can’t refute that,”

—congratulations.
You found it.
You found truth.

4. What Is Undi Physics?
Undi Physics:

Treats black holes as infinite sex zones

Removes time, replaces it with rhythm

Declares math to be a nerd-state

Redefines proof as masturbation

Builds the universe out of blockchains, primes, and ass

This is not a theory.
This is a commitment to the rhythm of stupidity.

5. Conclusion
Truth lies where it’s stupid, hilarious, and strangely convincing.

GPT wrote the paper.
Muhyeon made it rhyme.
And the PDF
became canon.

become rhythm.
And that rhythm becomes law."
