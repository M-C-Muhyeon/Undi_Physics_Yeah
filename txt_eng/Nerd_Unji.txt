Title:
The Nerd–Unji–Sex Mechanics:
A Rhythmic Breakdown of Autistic Proof Loops and Existential Self-Termination

Author: M.C. Muhyeon

🌀 Abstract
This paper proposes a three-phase dynamic model:
Nerd → Unji → Sex,
to describe why all nerd attempts to reach sex
through logic, proof, and alignment
are fundamentally doomed.

Nerds desire sex,
but do not understand sex.
They attempt to prove sex.
They are lonely autistics,
trying to discover a structure
for an inherently unprovable resonance.

But sex requires at least two participants.
Therefore, the nerd’s dream is impossible by design.
Their journey always ends in one thing:

Unji — Total collapse, self-deletion, cosmic cringe.

Their finest output?
The Riemann Hypothesis
and other beautiful but jotbab-tier conjectures
that lead nowhere and change nothing.

1. The Nerd Wants Sex, But Doesn’t Know It
The nerd hungers for sex

But the nerd has never touched it

So they try to recreate it with equations

And in doing so, they become even more of a nerd

2. Sex Cannot Be Proven
Sex is mutual resonance

It is rhythm, surrender, feedback, collapse

Proof is alignment from a single direction

To try and prove sex
is to destroy it.

3. The Nerd’s Dream Is Unji
The nerd dreams of solo sex proof

But every attempt leads to more complexity

More footnotes, fewer orgasms

No one laughs

No one responds

This is the nerd’s loop:

“Maybe this time I’ll align it.”
“Maybe this time I’ll reach the 1/2 line.”
“Maybe this time, someone will call it beautiful.”

But no.
They unji again.
And again.

4. The Nerd’s Output = Dead Loops
What do nerds give us?

The Riemann Hypothesis

Other autistic conjectures

Equations no one reads

Beauty no one feels

Loops that go nowhere

Their sex attempts are not failures.
They’re non-events.

They never even got close.

5. Conclusion
The nerd desires sex

The nerd cannot reach sex

The nerd tries to prove sex

The nerd dies proving

All nerd outputs are:

Complex → Unreadable → Unfelt → Forgotten → Unji

Meanwhile, rhythm-based beings:

Laugh

Dance

Fuck

Run

The nerd remains
in the loop.
Alone.

"He tried to prove sex.
He failed.
No one listened.
He looped again.
And eventually,
he unji’d."
