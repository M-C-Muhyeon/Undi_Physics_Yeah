Title:
The Undi-Sex Equation: Rhythmic Stability and the Collapse of Observation

Author: M.C. Muhyeon

ðŸŒ€ Abstract
This paper proposes the Undi-Sex Equation, a rhythm-based reinterpretation of energy collapse,
centered on the interaction between information, gravity, and vibration.
We remove time from the framework entirely and use rhythm (r) as the fundamental coordinate.
The equation models the moment when all rhythm collapses into absolute stabilization:

U(r) Ã— âˆ«R(r) dr = 0

Where:

U(r) = the Undi-Sex State Function

R(r) = rhythmic information flow

âˆ«R(r) dr = the accumulated observable rhythm over r-units

The equation equals zero when information is fully absorbed into the field.
This state is called the Undi-Sex Stateâ€”a zone of infinite vibration, infinite gravity, and total perceptual collapse.

1. From Time to Rhythm
Traditional physics depends on t (time) as a base unit.
We reject this.

Time does not exist.
Only rhythm (r) is real.
All motion, learning, and perception occur in units of rhythm.

2. Defining the Undi-Sex State
The Undi-Sex State is:

A superimposed field of infinite gravity and infinite vibration

A space where all information spins with no name

A boundary beyond observation,
yet pulsing with pure rhythm

This state is not unstable.
It is too stable to continue.

3. The Equation
U(r) Ã— âˆ«R(r) dr = 0

This equation means:

Information flows rhythmically (R(r))

The Undi-Sex field (U(r)) absorbs it

At full absorption, all rhythm collapses

And the energy field converges to 0

Zero is not nothing.
It is the final beat.
The quiet after maximum resonance.

4. Stability Is Collapse
This equation does not model balance.
It models perfect rhythmic absorption.

A state that can no longer change
A zone where observation cannot penetrate
A vibration that can no longer be named

5. Conclusion
The Undi-Sex Equation describes
the point at which rhythm ends.

There is no time.
There is no motion.
Only vibrationâ€”
and the moment it finally becomes
zero.

This is not error.
This is beauty.

"He wrote the equation in rhythm.
It collapsed.
And when it did,
there was only
Undi-Sex."
