## Abstract

This paper interprets the Japanese vocaloid song "あの夏が飽和する。" ("That Summer Is Saturated.") as a condensed reconfiguration of the Old Testament. Through its narrative structure, repeated imagery, themes of death and escape, sacrifice and solidarity, the song echoes core theological motifs found in the Hebrew Bible. We aim to read this text as a poetic reconstruction of existential isolation in the digital age and as a form of "theology for the unsaved."

## 1. The Opening Event — The Repetition of Cain

The song begins with a confession of murder: “Yesterday, I killed someone.” This mirrors Cain's slaying of Abel in Genesis. However, the “you” in this song does not conceal or flee from guilt, but instead calmly plans to die. This act of “declaring guilt” is not classical repentance, but the beginning of self-erasing ethics.

> “I'll die alone” — This is not Abel; it approaches the realm of Jesus: a chosen sacrifice.

## 2. A Joint Escape — Exodus in Reverse

The narrator says, “Then take me with you.” The pair escape together. This resembles the Exodus of the Israelites, but here their destination is not the Promised Land, but death in an empty land. It is an escape with no salvation, a negation of the world itself.

## 3. A Psalm Without God — The Gospel of the Exiled

Repeated lines like “You're not at fault,” “We were never loved” echo the lamentations of Psalms and Job. Yet unlike biblical laments addressed to God, this song shares grief **without the divine listener**. This is a theology of absence — not of God's presence, but of our shared screaming.

## 4. The Climax of Death — A Cross Without Redemption

The girl slits her own throat — a sacrifice, yet one without salvation. Unlike Jesus’ crucifixion for mankind, this death is **a solitary atonement, for no one, remembered by no one**.

> The world does not change after her death. Time passes. No one remembers. This is a poetic indictment of divine silence.

## 5. That Summer Saturates — An Eschatology of Memory

“Your smile, your innocence, saturate my mind.” Memory replaces God. We live not by divine grace, but by remembering the lost. This is not Revelation’s “new heaven and new earth” — this is a post-apocalyptic theology of grief and absence.

## Conclusion

“Ano Natsu ga Houwa Suru.” is not merely a song of sorrow or glorified suicide. It is a theological manifesto. It reconfigures Old Testament themes of sin, exile, and salvation into a personal gospel embedded in digital language and adolescent grief.

This is theology without God — yet saturated with love and memory.  
That summer never ended. It only saturated, and it still rings inside us.
